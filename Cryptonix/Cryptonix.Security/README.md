## Spiralizer

This is used to randomize the array data or crypt it.

Sample Array 1: { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 }

Sample Array 2: { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 }

Transform the linear array and spiralize it like here: 

![Spiralization sequence](../../docs/spiralizer_arrays.svg)

Sample Array 1 Spiralized: { 1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 6, 3, 2, 5 }

Sample Array 2 Spiralized: { 1, 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 9, 6, 3, 2, 5, 8 }

Despiralization is a data recovery process, reverse transformation.
